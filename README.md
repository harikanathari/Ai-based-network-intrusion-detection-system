# 🛡️ AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (Student Project)

This project demonstrates how to use **Machine Learning (Random Forest)** and **Generative AI (Grok)** to detect and explain network attacks (specifically DDoS).An AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a cybersecurity system that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to monitor network traffic and detect malicious activities or cyber attacks in real time.

In today’s digital world, networks are constantly exposed to threats such as hacking, malware, phishing, ransomware, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Traditional intrusion detection systems mainly rely on predefined rules or signatures, which means they can only detect known attacks. However, new and advanced attacks are continuously emerging.

To overcome this limitation, AI-based systems analyze network traffic patterns, learn from historical data, and identify unusual or suspicious behavior automatically.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Enter API Key:** Paste your Grok API key in the sidebar (optional, for AI explanations).
2. **Train Model:** Click the "Train AI Model" button. The system loads the `Friday-WorkingHours...` dataset automatically.
3. **Simulate:** Click "Simulate Random Packet" to pick a real network packet from the test set.
4. **Analyze:** See if the model flags it as **BENIGN** or **DDoS**, and ask Grok to explain why.
# #Goals&objectives

The main goal of the AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System is to develop an intelligent security system that can monitor network traffic and detect cyber attacks accurately using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques.

 Objectives

To monitor network traffic continuously and analyze data in real time.

To detect unauthorized access to the network system.

To identify different types of cyber attacks such as DoS, phishing, malware, and data breaches.

To detect unknown or zero-day attacks using anomaly detection techniques.

To reduce false alarms (false positives) and improve detection accuracy.

To generate instant alerts when suspicious activity is detected.

To improve system security and protect sensitive data.

To develop a scalable and efficient model that can handle large amounts of network data.

To continuously improve detection performance using machine learning algorithms.
# #Features
